                Udaivilas, Udaipur. Located down cascading stairways, linked by sunlit corridors and framed by floor-to-ceiling,
                glass panelled doors, our indoor and al fresco dining spaces combine the charm of Mewar architecture, with
                the finest culinary experiences. Views from our restaurants encompass either the hotel's landscaped gardens
